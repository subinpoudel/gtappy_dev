# Licensing of Harpy

Harpy, defined as everything within this subdirectory, is licensed under GPLv3. The rest of the project
currently uses the MIT license. The developer of Harpy, Forian Schiffmann, has granted and signed
an exception to the GPLv3 license for the use of Harpy in the gtappy project, allowing it to be included
in this MIT licensed project so long as the Harpy specific subdirectory stays under GPLv3.

## Changes from Harpy v3.1 master branch

Added manual dtype overrides.

Fixed a couple bugs with the fortran struct.
